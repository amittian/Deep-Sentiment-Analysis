Severity: 2

Migration Date: Â 07/14/2023

Â· Additional Notes: Client indicates that she is unable to access her voicemail. And the option to leave a voicemail to her number is available but, automated error recording displays and indicates â€œWe are sorry, this message cannot be sent, voicemail has to be 3 secondsâ€. Client indicates that this error message always displays whenever one of her contact try to leave a voicemail. Client is also having difficulty accessing her voicemail. 

Her voice intermittency is that while she calls one of her contacts and they answer said call, the call remains silent, and neither of them, the caller and the client are able to hear each other. Client indicates that multiple attempts must be made to get ahold of her contacts and be able to hear them. When client receives calls, she experiences no issues.  And on occasion, her calls drop in mid conversation. Images will be included for reference. Multiple cases regarding this issue have been previously escalated and issue still persists. Please evaluate the current status of the situation and provide us further assistance in the matter. Thanks\!

Additionally, client has also changed SIM card to TBS issue and has undergone through multiple TBS procedures such as Reset Network settings, APN configuration resets, and others.

* Device Model: iPhone 12 Mini
* IMEI: 352849421902275
* Notes: Called client 7873182115 - Confirming having issues with Voicemail.
*# Check Voicemail Settings:
** Open the Phone app.
*** Tap on the ""Voicemail"" tab at the bottom.
Ensure that your voicemail box is set up and there are no issues with your greeting or mailbox settings.Â *Client has never created a greeting on Voicemail, once he press tap to Voicemail. He would be able to see old voicemail messages.*
*# Restart Your iPhone:
** Restart your iPhone to refresh network connections.Â *After doing restart there is no change of current state, client cannot see new voicemail messages.*
*# Check Network Connection:
** Ensure that you have a stable cellular or Wi-Fi connection. Voicemail retrieval requires a data connection.Â *Cellular Data is On, has internet service, is not connected to a WIFI.*
*# Visual Voicemail:
** If you use Visual Voicemail, make sure it's set up correctly. Go to Settings > Phone > Voicemail.
*** Check if Visual Voicemail is enabled.Â *Client only uses Traditional voicemail (Audio)*
*# Call Voicemail Directly:
** Dial your voicemail directly by calling your own number and follow the prompts to check if there are any voicemail messages.Â *Client is trying to call voicemail by pressing and holding 1. Manage to confirm he had a new message that was made by his girlfriend, but did not get notification about it.*
*# Check Voicemail Box Capacity:
** Verify if your voicemail box is not full. If it's full, you may need to delete some voicemail messages.Â *Client has already tried this step before and issue still persisted. Trying again on call, client deleted all messages, result no change of current issue.*
*# Update Carrier Settings:
** Check if there are carrier settings updates available. Go to Settings > General > About.
*** If an update is available, you'll be prompted to install it.Â *17.2.1 Up to date*
*# Reset Network Settings:
** Go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings. This will reset Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular settings. Note: This will also remove saved Wi-Fi passwords.Â *Client apparently did not have the option for Reset Network Settings, so we activated Airplane mode instead for 30 seconds. Result: No change of current issue*
*# Update iOS:
** Ensure your iPhone is running the latest version of iOS. Updates can include fixes for known issues.Go to Settings > General > Software Update.Â *Software Up-to-date*
* Â 
10) Voicemail Password:
** If you have set up a voicemail password, make sure it's entered correctly. Go to Settings > Phone > Change Voicemail Password.Â *Client does not use any password to access voicemail.*
* 11) Roaming Status:
** If you are in a roaming area, ensure that roaming is enabled and check with your carrier about voicemail services in roaming. *Roaming is OFF*

"*Summary: Technical Issue - Unable to send long messages SMS on all phonelines & A2P Issue - 7875356784*

*Description: Please assist with the following*

* Customer Name: GLADYS V GONZALEZ LEON
* MSISDN: 17875356784, 17879343930, 17875035542 & 17879302971
* Device Model: Samsung Galaxies S22 & S23
* IMEI: 355796467464099, 355802956109086, 352642890021887 & 355802958062077
* Notes: Called client 7875356784 - Confirming having issues with SMS & A2P issue on all phonelines registered on account. A2P issue is with: Intuit, Paypal, and Sage.
* Troubleshooting done:
*# Check Message Settings:
** Open the messaging app and check for any specific settings related to long messages or character limits.Â *First step phone does not have option for limiting messaging. Option*
*# Split Long Messages:
** Manually split long messages into smaller parts before sending. Some carriers have limitations on the length of individual SMS messages.
*# Enable SMS/MMS Auto-Conversion:
** In the messaging app settings, ensure that the option to automatically convert long SMS messages to MMS is enabled. This is usually found in the messaging app's settings under ""Multimedia messages"" or a similar option.Â *SMS/MMS are active*
*# Update Messaging App:
** Ensure that your messaging app is updated to the latest version available on the Google Play Store.Â *Updated Latest version is installed 14*
*# Clear Messaging App Cache:
** Go to Settings > Apps > \[Messaging App], and clear the cache. This can resolve issues related to the app's temporary data.Â *Cache was cleared on Messaging App*
*# Check for Software Updates:
** Ensure that your device has the latest software updates installed. Updates may include bug fixes and improvements to messaging functionality.Â *Unable to make or search for new updates, but phone is already updated to latest version*
*# Verify Carrier Settings:
** Contact your mobile carrier and confirm if there are any specific limitations on SMS message length. They can also provide information on carrier-specific settings.Â *SIM registered to Liberty Network*
*# Reset Network Settings:
** Go to Settings > General management > Reset > Reset network settings. This will reset Wi-Fi, Mobile data, and Bluetooth settings, but it may resolve network-related issues affecting messaging.Â *Step is done. Result: Still having issue when sending long messages to other numbers from different companies that aren't from Liberty. He can only send short messages of two or three words.*
*# Try a Different Messaging App:
** Install and use a different messaging app from the Google Play Store to check if the issue persists. This can help determine if the problem is specific to the default messaging app.Â *Samsung Messaging and is using Google Messages App. Is also having issues with that app as well. Error that appears is as if a watch when trying to send message. Happening with companies that are foreign to Liberty. His clients are from USA and Local.*
* 10) SIM Card Check:
** Ensure that the SIM card is properly inserted and functioning. A faulty or improperly inserted SIM card can affect messaging functionality.Â *Removed SIM Card from device, then Restarted device after inserting SIM Card back. When accessing Google Messages there was an error stating: ""Trouble sending. Check options (but provides no options)"". When using Samsung Messaging setting up as default. ""Can't send messages Liberty 0.""*
* 11) Test with Different Contacts:
Verify if the issue occurs with messages sent to different contacts. This can help determine if the problem is contact-specific.Â *9545882737 (T-Mobile USA), 5699968513 (T-Mobile USA), 8502762622 (T-Mobile USA), 7874459979 (Claro PR), there are many other numbers, but again issue is with foreign companies.*
